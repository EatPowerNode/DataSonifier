# DataSonifier

Turn any file into a musical and visual experience! This script reads a file as a binary string, converts it into a step graph (inspired by the Nintendo sound chip), and plays it as a melody using a pentatonic scale.

## Downloads
Download the pre-built executable for your platform (no Python installation required):
- [Windows (64-bit)](https://placeholder-windows-url)
- [Linux (64-bit)](https://placeholder-linux-url)
- [macOS (64-bit)](https://placeholder-macos-url)

## Requirements
For running the Python script directly:
- Python 3.x
- Install dependencies:

  pip install matplotlib numpy pygame

## How to Run
### Option 1: Using the Executable
1. Download the executable for your platform from the links above.
2. **For Linux and macOS users:** Make the file executable after downloading:
 - Linux:
   ```
   chmod +x sonifier-linux
   ```
 - macOS:
   ```
   chmod +x sonifier-macos
   ```
3. Double-click the executable to run it (e.g., `sonifier-windows.exe` on Windows, `./sonifier-linux` on Linux, or `./sonifier-macos` on macOS).
4. A file dialog will open. Select any file to sonify (e.g., an executable, text file, or image).
5. A graph will display, showing the height path and rate of change of the binary data.
6. Choose a playback mode (Smooth Transitions, Sharp Tones, or No Derivative) using the radio buttons.
7. Click the "Play Sound" button to hear the file as a melody. Use "Stop Sound" to interrupt playback.

**Note:** On Windows, some antivirus programs may flag the executable as suspicious (a common false positive with PyInstaller). The executable is safe to use.

### Option 2: Using the Python Script
1. Save the script as `sonifier.py`.
2. Run the script:

   python sonifier.py

3. A file dialog will open. Select any file to sonify (e.g., an executable, text file, or image).
4. A graph will display, showing the height path and rate of change of the binary data.
5. Choose a playback mode (Smooth Transitions, Sharp Tones, or No Derivative) using the radio buttons.
6. Click the "Play Sound" button to hear the file as a melody. Use "Stop Sound" to interrupt playback.

## Features
- Visualizes binary data as a step graph with alternating runs highlighted in red.
- Plots the rate of change to show the trend driving the sound.
- Plays the data as a melody using a C major pentatonic scale, with options for smooth transitions, sharp tones, or raw height mapping.
- Interactive play/stop buttons and playback mode selector for a responsive UI.
- Non-blocking audio playback with seamless transitions and a piano-like quality.

## What's New
- Added audio device selection to reduce clicking.
- Added fade-in and fade-out envelopes to eliminate all popping and give a natural, piano-like quality to each tone.

## Example
Hereâ€™s what the output looks like when sonifying a random image file (`2UX91cwm55ck.png`):

![Example Output](example_screenshot.png)

The top graph shows the height path of the binary data, with alternating runs in red. The bottom graph shows the rate of change, which drives the sound. The result is a surprisingly musical melody with a rhythmic beat!

Try sonifying an image file (e.g., a PNG or JPEG) to hear and see its binary structure as music and a graph!
